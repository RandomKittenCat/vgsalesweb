First the user puts in a Genre, then a System, then a Rating. The first visual shows the ratings a game got from critics. The games are weeded out to fit in the genre, system, and ESRB rating requirements you inserted. The second visual shows basically the same things as the first, except, instead of using the critic ratings, it uses the user ratings. The user ratings seem to be higher because it is people looking to enjoy the game, not like the critics looking for flaws. The 3rd and final model show the sales of games that fit the genre, ESRB rating and system inputs. You can choose what matters most to you when deciding if you want to try out a game that fits your interests, what game sold the best, what game got the best ratings from users, or what game got the best ratings from critics. Sadly, there are less data points in the user ratings because we did not have the data available.</big>

  <center class="accordion-body"><br> Below I put "Platform" in the Genre section, "any" in the platform section, which is where you select what console you are on. And in the ESRB rating input I put "E" for everybody. Below, 3 charts are made based on the inputs I put in.
